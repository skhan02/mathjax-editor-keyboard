# MathJax Editor Keyboard

This intended to be a mathematics keyboard that adapts itself depending on user's device. So in desktop it would float around the input, while in mobile it would be fixed on the screen bottom. It will use [http://github.com/ianlucas/mathjax-editor](MathJax Editor), and will depend on MathJax and Google Material icons.

Also, it is based on Mathway's editor. :3
